# ConnectNet
Wi-Fi Direct Connection Framework on Android 4.1 or later

ConnectNet is a basic framework for abstracting the use of Wi-Fi Direct on Android mobile phones. Though not as refined as [PeerDeviceNet](http://peerdevicenet.net) or [AllJoyn](https://allseenalliance.org/about), it provides insight into the implementation of Wi-Fi Direct in Android. It can be used as is, or incorporated in other projects under the Apache 2.0 license.
